# Codex Wake

Codex Wake records wake requests and agent messages whose deadlines must remain meaningful across outages and restarts.

## Language

**Wake deadline**:
The point in time when a registered wake becomes due, including time spent asleep.

**Message expiration**:
The deadline after which a message is no longer eligible for delivery, including time spent asleep.

**Trusted time**:
A bounded estimate of current time accepted under the configured source-selection rules.

**Time uncertainty**:
The condition in which available evidence cannot establish whether a deadline has passed.

**Scheduling intent**:
The durable original request to schedule one follow-up, retained even when a
clock cannot yet qualify its deadline. Reusing its key returns that request;
it does not authorize another submission.

**Relative clock continuity**:
Evidence that elapsed observations belong to the same qualified host-counter
epoch and rate policy. Losing continuity holds the original anchor rather than
starting the delay again. Elapsed evidence does not establish absolute UTC.

**Message receipt**:
An attributable record of retrieval, acceptance or another message outcome.
Reading records retrieval; it does not accept the work.

**Work claim**:
The exact recipient's explicit acceptance of processing a message. Only a newly
accepted claim permits that worker to begin; it grants no additional task rights.
Successful or failed processing requires this claim before terminal acknowledgment.

**Receipt publication**:
Making an existing receipt available to observers. Publication is durable journal
work and does not itself require the recipient's tab to remain open.

**Recovery disposition**:
The operator's attributable decision to retain snapshot-era work as unknown and
prohibit its processing or replay. It does not infer missing outcomes.

**Recovery hold release**:
A separate operator action after committed disposition. It leaves the bus paused
and requires fresh grants before new work; original history stays fenced.

**Agent spawn**:
Starting a separate agent conversation with an explicit assignment and scope.

**Compact dispatch packet**:
A bounded assignment containing objective, authority, scope, acceptance, evidence
locators, allowance, stop conditions and governance readback requirements. It
starts fresh context by default; full-history context requires a recorded
task-specific reason and a pinned source. A packet snapshot creates no authority.

**Agent refresh**:
Reloading selected runtime resources while preserving the conversation identity
and unfinished work. Legacy profiles reopen its client; approved shared MCP
refresh keeps clients and reconnects the shared server's MCP connections after
idle observations. Neither path renews counters or resource allocation.

**Agent handoff**:
Passing an unfinished objective and its checkpoint to a different conversation,
continuing its already-authorized scope, cumulative spending, remaining allowance
and original deadline. It does not renew resources, change identity or widen
permissions, and does not require optional governor enrollment in manual mode.

**Handoff checkpoint**:
The outgoing agent's durable account of completed work, remaining work, evidence,
authority, pending obligations and resource allowance for its successor to verify.

**Lifecycle controller**:
The external owner that observes and coordinates an agent's lifecycle transition.

**Continuation allowance**:
The explicitly authorized resources remaining for work on the same objective.
Fresh context does not replenish that allowance.

**Session budget**:
The user-authorized token and elapsed-time limits for one agent goal session.

**Objective budget**:
The user-authorized cumulative token and elapsed-time limits for an objective,
including successors, reviewers, delegated work, retries and failed attempts.
Changing conversation does not replenish this budget.

**Resource allocation**:
The resources a user authorizes for a named objective and its continuations.
Conversation identity does not determine or replenish that authority.

**Allocation renewal**:
An explicit user change to a named objective's resource allocation. It does not
change unrelated allocations or erase their usage history.

**Allocation continuity**:
The verified relationship that charges a successor's work to the same objective's
existing allocation, preserving cumulative usage and its original deadline.

**Caller provisioning**:
Binding a verified conversation to the resource authority it may exercise.
Provisioning alone is not proof of accounting or running enforcement.

**Goal supervision**:
Observing an existing goal's authorized resource usage, requesting a checkpoint
before its limits, and pausing continuation when its stopping condition is reached.

**External goal watcher**:
The independent process observing one goal/allocation and requesting native
checkpoint, pause and exact-turn interruption. Configuration alone does not prove
that the watcher is running or has accepted an enrollment.

**Allowance extension**:
An explicitly authorized increase to an allocation's ceiling or deadline that
retains the resources already consumed. This is a form of allocation renewal.

**Budget window reset**:
An explicitly authorized new allocation generation/window with a qualified usage
anchor. Prior charges, stop history and native counters remain intact; a zero
current-window counter does not mean zero lifetime usage of that objective.

**Enforcement notice**:
A durable explanation of watcher engagement, checkpoint, stop or supervision loss
for model context and operator presentation. Recording, control acknowledgement,
presentation and operator response are separate proof boundaries. The visible
notice/renewal workflow is planned under #343, not established by this definition.

**Handoff preflight**:
The successor's verification of runtime readiness and assessment of whether the
outgoing work advanced the approved objective with adequate evidence and scope
discipline. Runtime readiness alone does not establish work acceptance.


**Emergency pause**:
An operator-controlled hold preventing new wake deliveries in its selected scope
until explicitly resumed. It preserves scheduled work and original deadlines.

**Wake cancellation**:
Retiring an eligible wake so it no longer delivers, while preserving its history.
It cannot retract work already submitted to a recipient.

**Owned-turn interruption**:
Stopping a running turn only when durable assignment evidence identifies it as
Wake-owned. It is separate from pausing future deliveries and cancelling wakes.

**Recipient binding**:
The verified relationship between one conversation and the live client that
currently owns its input. A tab label or working directory alone is not a binding.

**Observed delivery**:
Inspection evidence that a wake prompt was accepted in the bound recipient's
interface. It does not establish a receiver acknowledgment or a work claim.

**Receiver acknowledgment**:
An attributable receipt from the exact recipient confirming a specified delivery
outcome. Its meaning is limited to that outcome; it does not imply completed work.

**Busy delivery policy**:
The selected behavior when an exact recipient is already working: wait, verified
queueing or explicitly authorized interruption, within the original deadline.


**Host-bound runtime actor context**:
An operator-issued mailbox actor capability paired with a private frozen runtime
binding. Grok invocation checks the managed process generation, inherited session
claim, caller ancestry and enrolled root. This is host delegation, not native Grok
caller attestation; terminal text and claimed IDs alone grant no work authority.

**Definitive pre-I/O non-submission**:
Positive adapter evidence that a selected method was unavailable before any
submission bytes. An absent response, missing marker or timeout is insufficient.
Only a host-approved fallback profile may switch methods on this evidence.


**Terminal attachment**:
A particular terminal view associated with a conversation. Its label and position
are separate from the conversation's identity.

**Managed agent**:
An agent whose one exact conversation, execution context and permitted operations
are explicitly tracked by a controller. Its identity survives verified process
and terminal changes; a successor conversation is a separate managed agent.

**Agent instruction**:
One bounded agent turn admitted as a declared instruction in a workflow.

**Step attempt**:
One attempt to execute a declared workflow operation. Its reported completion
and acceptance are separate outcomes.

**Work acceptance**:
An evidence-backed decision that a result meets its declared acceptance
conditions. A worker's completion report alone is not that decision.

**Scheduled occurrence**:
One planned execution arising from a recurring schedule, distinct from attempts
to deliver or execute that occurrence.

**Wake durability**:
The interruptions or owner lifecycles a retained wake is required to survive.
Durability is separate from its deadline and delivery outcome.

**Parking a tab**:
Moving a live terminal attachment into a holding workspace while preserving its
agent. Parking alone does not pause work or renew resource allowance.



**Session permission profile**:
A named set of action permissions a session may use under operator authority.
Selecting a profile does not establish session identity or provide more resource allowance.

**Mandatory permission prohibition**:
An operator restriction that a more permissive profile or session-specific rule cannot override.
**Agent succession**:
The relationship between a predecessor and successor managed agent continuing
the same task, with outstanding obligations and resource continuity preserved.

**Task brief**:
The approved objective, phase, boundaries, acceptance conditions and context for
an assignment. An admitted instruction refers to a particular revision.

**Recipient-startup policy**:
The selected conditions under which a wake may use an existing recipient, load
a saved conversation or start its declared task. It is separate from wake lifetime.

**Semantic agent state**:
A fresh evidence-backed account of what an exact managed conversation is doing.
It is distinct from binding readiness, work acceptance and permission to act.

**Mutation resource claim**:
Exclusive cooperative custody of a declared resource while work may mutate it.
Losing contact with its owner does not release custody or authorize a new writer.

**Acceptance contract**:
An approved immutable set of checks bound to one exact task-brief assignment pin.
An evaluation records independent evidence; missing or stale evidence is unknown.

**Input owner generation**:
The current cooperative custody token for automated or human terminal input.
A takeover changes the generation and fences old automated operations.

**Attention response**:
An attributable operator answer to a specific current request. Recording an answer
alone grants no permission, executes no effect and authorizes no uncertain replay.

**Background job result wake**:
An existing exact-owner wake observing the durable result of one approved bounded
local job. Awaiting the result does not relaunch the job or renew its task allowance.

**Governor**:
The operator-visible controller that applies authorized resource limits to a selected objective and explains its interventions to the operator and model.

**Governor deactivation**:
The operator's durable choice to stop governor interventions in a selected scope. It preserves accounting and work, does not renew resources or resume stopped work, and remains in effect until explicitly changed.

**Host compatibility preflight**:
A bounded read-only check before opted-in dispatch, separating reusable static
host observations from fresh accounting, controller and operator-control state.
It reports the actual enforcement mode without granting work or resource authority.

**Protected completion resources**:
The unused acceptance, review and bounded remediation estimates retained inside
an existing objective allowance. Host-bound completion work may use them;
implementation must leave them available. Deferral keeps mandatory work pending,
and verified completion releases unused protection without renewing the grant.


**Logical agent**:
A durable controller identity linking an agent's work across explicitly related
conversations and runtime instances. Keeping this identity does not transfer
credentials, permissions or resource allowance.

**Conversation**:
A provider or coding runtime's durable record of an exchange. A successor
conversation has its own identity and retains a relationship to its predecessor.

**Runtime instance**:
A particular running instance of a coding agent or app server. It is distinct
from the durable conversations it can serve.

**Presentation attachment**:
A terminal pane, TUI connection or structured client connection through which a
runtime can be presented or accessed. Replacing an attachment does not by itself
replace the conversation or logical agent.

**Resource binding**:
The explicit relationship between a stable controller resource identity and its
scoped native representations. A binding identifies context; it grants no action
or resource authority.

**Resolved operation target**:
The particular resource identity and instance selected for one operation.
Subsequent label reuse or instance replacement does not redirect that operation.

**Searchable agent inventory**:
A view relating agents and conversations to their accounts, execution contexts,
runtimes, presentation attachments and control relationships. Names and stable
identifiers can locate observations, whose freshness and uncertainty remain visible.

**Upgrade recovery**:
Continuing work paused by a specific daemon upgrade from its durable checkpoint,
under the same authority, remaining allowance, deadline and conversation identity.
It does not resume work that was already paused or grant new resources.

**Recovery acceptance**:
Durable evidence that one recovery continuation was admitted for an exact upgrade
and conversation. An absent reply does not prove that continuation was rejected.

**Unknown recovery delivery**:
A recorded recovery attempt whose acceptance cannot be established. It remains
held for reconciliation rather than authorizing another attempt.

**Upgrade resource authority**:
Host-owned evidence binding a recovery to the original goal, tenant/account, policy, cumulative accounting and limits. The trusted TUI user action establishes original native policy when creating a native goal, and may carry already verified native policy through later controls without changing its grant. A later status action cannot convert an existing unknown or externally controlled goal into native-only authority. Model handoffs cannot establish this declaration; absent or unverifiable authority keeps recovery held.

**Upgrade candidate**:
A particular proposed build under evaluation for selection, identified separately from the currently selected working build.

**Upgrade job**:
A durable, bounded attempt to qualify an upstream release for a configured scope, retaining its progress, evidence and consumed budget across restarts.

**Future-launch promotion**:
Selecting a qualified build for subsequent launches in a defined scope while existing sessions retain their current build.
