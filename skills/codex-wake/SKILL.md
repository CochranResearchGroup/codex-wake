name: codex-wake
description: Use Codex Wake when a user gives /goal resource limits (tokens, time, memory, swap, CPU, tasks): register token/time limits for the existing native goal through MCP; an independent watcher requests checkpoint then pauses the goal and interrupts its exact active turn. Dedicated host-approved executors provide separate memory/CPU controls. Also use it for durable agent-to-agent requests, correlated replies, exclusive work claims, suspended reply wakes, session/tab lookup, wake listing/cancellation and persistent emergency pause, host-approved worker spawn, self-refresh of skill/MCP resources with approved shared reload after idle checks, fresh-context handoff, and scheduled follow-ups. Prefer its MCP tools for tracked exchanges when configured; use the CLI otherwise.

# Codex Wake

Use durable triggers when work must resume after a defined event. Load the
matching reference before acting; inspect the returned receipt before claiming
registration, delivery, enforcement or refresh.

Use your actual native caller identity and existing objective allocation.
Successors retain cumulative spend, the original deadline and stop latches.
New enrollment defaults to fresh input plus output; re-enrollment preserves its
accounting basis. Verify a fresh independent controller and qualified accounting
before externally supervised campaign work. An explicit operator choice of manual
resource monitoring permits bounded development/repair under the same cumulative
limits; report the fallback and keep shared services and stopped campaigns unchanged. A held campaign still permits operator replies,
bounded setup diagnosis and checkpoint writing. Only explicit user renewal
recorded through host authority creates a new allowance.

For refresh, inspect the profile's scope and preserve one fixed intent. Shared
MCP refresh requires all affected conversations idle; queued admission is not
verified refresh. Client replacement alone does not prove MCP reconnection.

Detailed workflows and examples remain in [workflows](references/workflows.md).

## Managed harness additions (0.21 source)

Use `wake_agents_list/show/enroll/reconcile` for persistent managed identity and
verified self-enrollment. Operator unenrollment remains effective until explicitly
re-enabled; inventory membership grants no operations.

Use `wake_task_briefs_propose/approve/inspect/admit/pin` to freeze approved scope
for an instruction. A worker proposal cannot approve itself; controller approval
is delegated by private host policy. Carry the exact admitted pin in checkpoints.

Use `wake_native_after/at/file` for exact-self scheduled intent with explicit
lifetime and recipient startup. New registration defaults to configurable
create/load/run, but a missing runtime capability remains unsupported. Disk
persistence is not monitor or delivery proof. `wake_owner_complete` reconciles an
exact operator-approved completion event; identity alone cannot declare an owner
finished, and absent evidence holds. It never replays an uncertain submission. See
repository docs/managed-inventory.md, docs/task-briefs.md and docs/wake-policy.md
for the source contracts. This source update does not refresh installed skills.
