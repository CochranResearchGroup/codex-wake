# Clock-based recurring checks

Work item: #615; parent spec: #610.

Use `schedules register --request FILE` with an explicitly agreed clock cadence:

```json
{
  "kind": "clock",
  "times": ["09:00", "17:00"],
  "timezone": "America/Chicago",
  "start_at": "2026-11-13T00:00:00Z",
  "gap_policy": "skip",
  "fold_policy": "first"
}
```

This is the `cadence` field inside the existing complete schedule request. Mode,
end condition, missed-run/max-lateness policy, overlap bounds and delivery window
remain explicit fields of that request. `times` contains distinct local `HH:MM`
values; `start_at` is an inclusive timezone-qualified bound.

`gap_policy` chooses `skip` (omit a nonexistent local clock time) or
`shift_forward` (advance by the timezone transition gap, so a missing 02:30 in
a one-hour gap becomes 03:30). `fold_policy` chooses `first`, `second` or `both`
for a repeated clock time. `both` creates distinct UTC occurrences. Explicit clock
times that resolve to the same UTC instant identify one due instant.

Wake calculates UTC due anchors using the host's installed IANA timezone database.
Persisted occurrences keep their original due/expiry anchors after a restart;
interval schedules retain elapsed-time semantics. This source implementation and
local validation do not establish installed monitor readiness or live delivery.

## Local acceptance evidence

Seam: operator schedule registration/show plus the existing `poll_schedules`
boundary, using real schedule persistence and only injected trusted-clock evidence.
No private sessions, native provider inputs or extra fixture framework were used.

Environment: Python 3.12.13 from the existing development venv, source via
`PYTHONPATH=src`, temporary isolated schedule roots. Red/green command:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src /home/ecochran76/workspace.local/codex-wake/.venv/bin/python \
  -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_recurring_calendar.py -q
```

Observed red outcomes, each before its implementation: missing calendar module;
fall `both` incorrectly advanced directly to the next day; spring `shift_forward`
incorrectly skipped the day. Final green: four tests passed, covering real
registration, spring gap choices, repeated-hour occurrences, missing explicit DST
choice, and original due/expiry retention across a repeated poll.

Interval regression:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src /home/ecochran76/workspace.local/codex-wake/.venv/bin/python \
  -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_recurring_schedules.py -q
```

Result: three passed at the ticket base plus this change. No hosted CI ran.

Documentation custody: worker `persistent_clock_615`, branch
`feat/persistent-wake-clock-615`, base `34a1cef677a9c1180f501f8078bcfb98a8902d5a`.
This checkout isolates #615 from concurrent live/background work; retain until
integration and durable custody are verified, then remove through normal worktree
cleanup. It was added after inspecting the registered inventory (122 before,
123 after; other checkouts are outside this worker's custody).

Memory disposition: `not_durable` for this worker checkpoint; the coordinator owns
final integrated closeout and no memory was written.
