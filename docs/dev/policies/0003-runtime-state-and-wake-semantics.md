# Runtime State And Wake Semantics

## Policy

- Treat wake requests as durable runtime records, not transient prompts.
- Classify runtime material before deciding whether it belongs in git:
  - durable authoritative wake state
  - durable but derived indexes
  - ephemeral caches and logs
  - secrets, credentials, and sensitive transcript content
- Keep tracked repo files separate from user-scoped runtime state unless a plan explicitly makes a fixture or sample part of the product.
- Prefer structured, inspectable state such as JSON, SQLite, or YAML over opaque scheduler state when practical.
- Make state schema changes deliberate and documented.
- Keep secrets, raw credentials, and private transcript bodies out of tracked fixtures and examples.

## Wake Record Contract

A wake record should make these fields explicit when applicable:

- stable wake id
- creating agent or session identifier
- creation time
- trigger definition
- earliest wake time or trigger polling policy
- status
- resume payload or retrieval pointer
- evidence path for trigger evaluation
- retry, timeout, and cancellation policy
- retention or cleanup expectation

## Status Semantics

- Use a small explicit status vocabulary.
- Completion, timeout, cancellation, and trigger failure must be distinguishable.
- Do not infer success from the presence of a wake record alone.
- Preserve enough evidence to explain why a wake fired, expired, or was cancelled.
