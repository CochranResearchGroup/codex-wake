# #369: Concurrent accounts and identifiable, maintainable Codex builds

State: APPROVED_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION. Owner: ecochran76 / primary coordinator. Coordinating issue: https://github.com/CochranResearchGroup/codex-wake/issues/369. Related workspace recovery: #368. This draft consolidates the approved interview; test boundaries and ticket breakdown approved by the explicit implement-spec invocation. Implementation is not complete.

## Problem Statement

Switching previously authenticated Codex profiles now repeatedly requests login. The cause and first affected release remain unknown. The current launcher can use an official client against a modified shared backend while both show the same upstream version. The operator wants concurrent accounts, common skills/settings/MCP connections, unified history discovery, genuine stock side-by-side operation, and straightforward upgrades without disrupting work or silently dropping modifications.

## Solution

Extend codex-profiles as the account launcher and shared-configuration owner. Keep account authentication and writable runtime state isolated. Add explicit stock/modded build selection, visible actual client/backend/account identity, and supported cross-profile discovery. Normal resume returns to the owning account. Explicit continuation under another account creates a linked successor. Provide automatic update discovery, reproducible staging and explicit activation/rollback, backed by real installed-path tests in a disposable WSL environment.

## User Stories

1. As an operator, I want to log in once per account so ordinary profile switching retains authentication.
2. As an operator, I want A → B → A to select the correct saved account every time.
3. As an operator, I want accounts A and B running simultaneously without either changing the other's credentials.
4. As an operator, I want existing profile names and aliases preserved.
5. As an operator, I want shell and executable launchers to resolve the same configuration.
6. As an operator, I want plain codex to launch the modified build under my selected account.
7. As an operator, I want an explicit stock command that actually uses an official backend.
8. As an operator, I want a persistent account and STOCK/MODDED indicator reflecting the connected backend.
9. As an operator, I want exact upstream/build/patch identities and supported capabilities inspectable.
10. As an operator, I want one shared skills/settings/MCP configuration to maintain.
11. As an operator, I want supported operator-level MCP logins reused regardless of Codex account.
12. As an operator, I want necessary connector/account/channel overrides explicit and inspectable.
13. As an operator, I want to browse conversations from all selected tenant homes without shared writable databases.
14. As an operator, I want ordinary resume to select the conversation's owning account.
15. As an operator, I want compatible stock and modified builds to access the same tenant's conversations.
16. As an operator, I want duplicate activation of the same conversation prevented across channels.
17. As an operator, I want incompatible versions to preserve my history and explain what is unsupported.
18. As an operator, I want explicit continuation with another account to create a linked successor with available history.
19. As an operator, I want original conversation provenance, goals and cumulative accounting preserved across continuation.
20. As an operator, I want automatic notification of upstream releases and visible custom-build lag.
21. As an operator, I want one command to build, qualify and stage a modified upgrade.
22. As an operator, I want an explicit switch and known-good rollback that preserve running work until cutover.
23. As an operator, I want failed builds/tests to leave my active package intact.
24. As an operator, I want realistic isolated upgrade tests without importing production credentials.
25. As an operator, I want disposable caches and inactive payload archives so testing does not consume primary storage indefinitely.
26. As an operator, I want exact account/channel/conversation identity available to later workspace recovery.
27. As an operator, I want genuine authentication expiry distinguished from an account-routing regression.
28. As an operator, I want explicit partial results and uncertain-operation reconciliation rather than silent fallbacks.

## Implementation Decisions

- codex-profiles owns existing profile aliases, selected account home, effective shared configuration and launch management. Native Codex owns actual client/backend identity, capabilities and complete-package runtime behavior. Wake consumes those identities for lifecycle/continuation; it must not introduce a competing account selector.
- Account selection and stock/modded selection are separate dimensions. Plain codex defaults to modified; the explicit stock command selects an official backend. Distinct runtime endpoint/package selection prevents accidental cross-channel connections.
- Preserve one tenant's conversation identity across compatible channels. Resolve writable database concurrency through the native supported ownership boundary; separate sockets alone do not make two database writers safe. Before removing current profile concurrency restrictions, prove account/channel endpoint isolation and safe native store access. If unsupported, report the limitation rather than silently duplicate or migrate sessions.
- Use versioned, inspectable build manifests for upstream base, patch revision, executable identity and capability results. Show actual account/backend identity at connection, reconnect and resume. Launcher labels alone are insufficient; unsupported stock identity features must be stated rather than represented as verified.
- Keep Codex login credentials account-local using existing native credential-store behavior. Do not rotate, copy or overwrite live credentials to simulate successful switching. Retain existing profile configuration edits during migration.
- Share common settings, skills, rules and MCP server definitions through the existing profile configuration owner. Share operator-level MCP authentication only through the connector's supported scope. Per-account exceptions are explicit. Effective configuration is inspectable; unsupported configuration is surfaced. Shared edits reach new launches; live refresh is explicit and does not silently restart peers.
- Cross-tenant session discovery is read-only and version-aware, retaining owning tenant/native namespace provenance. Ordinary resume routes to that owner. Equal directory names, tab names and latest activity do not establish identity.
- Compatible channel switching retains the tenant's conversation and enforces a durable active-conversation fence. Uncertain prior launch or stale ownership is reconciled from native evidence before another launch. Unknown incompatible schemas hold without destructive conversion.
- Explicit continue-with-account creates a separate linked successor using all available supported history; retain source provenance and disclose unsupported/truncated history. Original records remain intact. Resource/goal continuity must use the existing cumulative allocation owner; absent or exhausted authority does not become a fresh allowance. Preparing/resuming context does not imply replay of uncertain pending actions.
- Automatic update discovery does not activate upgrades. Staging verifies official provenance, applies the minimal versioned patches, produces a complete identifiable package, and runs capability acceptance. Patch conflicts, missing capabilities and failing checks preserve the active version.
- Activate a staged build explicitly, handling affected sessions and durable state compatibility. Rollback is qualified against supported database/history schemas; never promise an executable rollback reverses an irreversible data migration. Keep a compatible snapshot/rollback route or hold activation.
- Use an existing disposable WSL fixture, preserving unrelated contents and placing this lab in a dedicated run directory. Isolate test homes, daemon endpoints, temporary credential stores and provider fixtures; production accounts/secrets are not needed for initial tests. A separate user namespace or isolated keyring must prevent the fixture from reading the host's production credential store.
- Stage active payloads on primary storage, separate rebuildable caches from retained packages and evidence, and archive selected inactive loads to a verified HDD target. Record checksums/provenance and verify restoration before deleting staged copies. Logical VHD space is not physical drive capacity. Never move a live VHD or reset unrelated fixtures.
- Expose tenant, namespace, build/channel, logical binding and supported resume capability for HF-19. Implementing complete Byobu restoration remains #368, not an implicit deliverable here.

## Testing Decisions

Proposed highest public boundary: invoke actual account/channel launchers as subprocesses against isolated real native backends and durable tenant homes; inspect connected account identity, package identity, history, effective configuration and effects. Existing profile CLI tests and native scoped-reload/notice/history-recovery tests supply prior art. Prefer those seams over tests mirroring internal helper logic.

For authentication, first obtain a red-capable deterministic A → B → A regression at the actual launch/auth-storage boundary. Compare pinned known-working and affected builds when evidence identifies them. Test credential reload/refresh rotation with synthetic responses and an isolated test keyring. Shell/executable configuration differences are hypotheses, not established root cause. If supported native auth cannot be simulated faithfully, record the missing boundary and preserve the failure; a fabricated successful login is not acceptance.

The WSL product matrix covers two tenants × stock/modded, sequential switching, parallel distinct conversations, duplicate-conversation rejection, restart, reconnect, shared config/MCP resolution, schema compatibility refusal, staged upgrade failure, activation and compatible rollback. Test foreign explicit endpoints and mismatched client/backend identity. Start with owned local fixtures and no external provider calls.

Native capability qualification covers scoped MCP reload without peer disturbance, durable notices without model work, genuine caller/accounting provenance and orphan-output recovery. Unsupported stock capabilities are expected explicit differences. Identify source, package, installed runtime and operator-path acceptance independently. Local synthetic authentication proves local persistence/routing; a later real-account canary is a separate authority and evidence gate, not silently replaced with fake-auth success.

The acceptance packet retains build hashes, commands, red/green output, fixture identity, cumulative-accounting invariants, owned-process cleanup and remaining gaps. No full-scope pass is claimed from a version string, nonempty auth file or unit test count.

## Out of Scope

Complete Byobu restore (#368); business/provider experiments; production account login/logout; automatic account substitution; credential copying; governor activation; resource renewal/reset; global WSL shutdown; deleting prior fixture contents; silent live daemon restarts; unrestricted cross-host tenant discovery. These may not be inferred from test setup authorization.

## Further Notes

Approved choices: shared history within a tenant across compatible builds; owner-routed resume; explicit linked successor across accounts; modified default launch; shared supported MCP operator identity; automatic update checks with explicit activation; full available successor history with preserved accounting; existing disposable WSL setup and staged/HDD payload handling.

Current evidence: the original profile authentication regression has not been reproduced. Separate account auth files exist, but validity and account routing are unproven. The fixture is prepared, not acceptance-tested. Existing profile documentation still restricts cross-account concurrency. The running modified native package has independent tests but broader installed acceptance remains incomplete. #369 is coordination; children close only on their own named delivery target.

Definition of done: approved child outcomes delivered through installed paths in the disposable environment, one integrated compatibility/upgrade receipt with explicit remaining live gates, truthful documentation and no automatic production cutover.
