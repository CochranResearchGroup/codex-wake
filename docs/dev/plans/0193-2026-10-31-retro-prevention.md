## Current State

Tickets440–443 are implemented, integrated and validated on14b90c9. Canonical PR445 merged204680c and all four children closed. Single review completed with one shared P2 privacy finding; one bounded TDD pass resolves it,22 focused cases pass on each Python3.11/3.12. Final privacy/evidence PR and protected ref readback remain publication gates. Source-bound runner356 is reused. Three substantive lanes maximum; integration/shared documentation serialized by primary. No live cleanup/native/service/provider effects. All tests use disposable state. Review1/1 and final findings TDD1/1. Frozen comparison5df7c81...204680c; see [review evidence](../evidence/issue0439/review.md). No repeat broad review.

## Scope and acceptance

Spec439 is canonical outcome authority. Public seams: cleanup plan/apply on disposable Git trees; existing source-bound validation command; bounded read-only summary command. Deliver safe unknown retention, drift refusal, normal disposable removal and exact missing-registration cleanup; isolated fail-fast repository validation; <=8192-byte summaries with truthful omissions.443 proves integrated behavior and concise invocation guidance. Preserve first failures privately.

## Shared contract and ownership

Primary owns scripts/cleanup_worktrees.py, tests/test_cleanup_worktrees.py, this plan and lane catalog.441 owns existing candidate runner plus a repository local validation launcher/profile and source-bound validation guidance/tests.442 owns scripts/summarize_receipt.py and its public tests; no shared plan/catalog edits.443 adds integrated acceptance/evidence/navigation after dependencies validate.

Cleanup receipt contract: schema="codex-wake.cleanup.v1", kind="plan" or "result", status="PASS"/"HELD"/"FAIL", repository string, entries array. Each entry has id,path,head strings; action="retain"/"remove"/"prune"; disposition="eligible"/"retained_unknown"/"retained"/"removed"/"pruned"/"failed"/"unknown"; reasons array of strings. Additional fields are allowed. A result retains the plan entries with final dispositions. Physical eligibility never follows solely from this schema: exact live evidence and authority are required. Summary supports this schema and existing candidate receipt schema1 only; do not print raw command output/environment data.

Private detailed receipts: user-state implement439. Commits/merges, validations and tracker closure are distinct. Changes reach canonical main through reviewed PRs under existing integration policy; local checks satisfy CI. Parent439 remains unmodified.

## Completion

All four children validated and tracker-closed; one broad Standards/Spec review and one bounded TDD findings pass complete, exact final branch/ref/status and protected state read back. Existing retained inventory is never a deletion test target. No hosted CI spending, install, resource renewal, governor activation, privilege grants or global instruction changes.
